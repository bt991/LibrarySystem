# LibrarySystem

This project was developed as a final project for CSI410. The objective was to create a program which contains a database, and my solution was to create this application which acts as a library sign-in system.

The user has the ability to sign in, edit their user credentials, check which books are in stock within the library, and request to take out books and see which books they've already taken out.

There's also admin functionality where an admin has the ability to update user information, remove users from the system, view all the users within the system, see which books are being rented by which user, and the ability to oreder new books for the library.
